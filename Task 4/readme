# ðŸŽ¯ Task 4 â€“ Optimization Model: Production Planning

**Internship Project - ELiteTEch (Data Science)**

---

## âœ… Problem Statement

A company manufactures two products (A and B), using two machines.  
Each product requires a certain amount of machine time, and the company wants to **maximize profit** without exceeding machine availability.

---

## ðŸ§® Mathematical Model

Let:
- A = units of Product A  
- B = units of Product B  

Maximize:  
> **Profit = 30Ã—A + 20Ã—B**

Subject to:
- 1Ã—A + 2Ã—B â‰¤ 40 (Machine 1 hours)
- 2Ã—A + 1Ã—B â‰¤ 50 (Machine 2 hours)
- A, B â‰¥ 0

---

## ðŸ’¡ Tools Used

- Language: Python
- Library: `pulp` (Linear Programming Solver)

---

## ðŸ”Ž Solution

| Variable   | Value    |
|------------|----------|
| Product A  | 10 units |
| Product B  | 15 units |
| Profit     | $600     |

---

## ðŸ“Œ Insights

- The optimal production plan suggests **10 units of A** and **15 units of B**.
- This utilizes machine time efficiently and yields **maximum profit** under the given constra
