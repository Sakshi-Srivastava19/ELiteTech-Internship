ðŸ”§ Task 1 Completed: Data Pipeline Development ðŸš€

Iâ€™ve successfully built an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn as part of my ELiteTEch Internship in Data Science. ðŸ”¥

âœ… Loaded raw data
âœ… Handled missing values
âœ… Performed feature transformation and scaling
âœ… Saved the processed dataset for further modeling

Building clean and efficient data pipelines is one of the most crucial steps in any data science project. ðŸ“Š
